This mod will prevent having to spend huge amounts of time farming loot and adds other conveniences. It's highly configurable. Here's a summary of the features (see forum page for more info).

- Item chances for certain enemy drops. Item values scale to new drop rates by default.
- Potions for using more bobbers (3-tiers).
- A chance for Angler to reset. Default starts at 0%, but later increases.
- Moonball to advance Moon Phase or skip the Blood Moon.
- Greater + Super Battle Potion to increase enemy spawns.
- Faster time flow while sleeping.
- Holiday timeline for periodic Halloween and Christmas days.
- Cancel Invasions when all players go underground.
- Helpful recipes including Universal Plyon.

====TEMPORARY UNTIL 1.4.4:====

- Celestial Sigil is crafted with 12 of each fragment and summons the Moon Lord in 12 seconds.
- Pirate drops are twice as likely. Pirate Ships will always drop 1 Golden Furniture item.

====OFF BY DEFAULT====

- Reduce Bestiary requirement for Universal Pylon.
- Staff of Difficulty. Changes difficulty settings.
