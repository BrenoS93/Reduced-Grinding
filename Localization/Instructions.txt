Make a fork of my mod at github: https://github.com/dragon3025/Reduced-Grinding (call it something like "ReducedGrinding<LanguageAbbreviation>)" (for example "ReducedGrindingJA"). Copy the Localization file found here: https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/blob/master/ExampleMod/Localization/en-US.lang to the Localization folder. You can edit the Localization directly at github, or you can click on the "code" dropdown menu then select "download zip", then extract the zip file contents to a folder. Follow the translation instructions at in the en-US.hjson file. You can then create a pull request to get the changes merged.

There is more text in my mod that can be translated, if you have visual studio and know how to build and publish mods. I added "Localize" comments everwhere in my mod that can be translated. You can edit this and publish a translated version of my mod, just make sure to credit me as the original author.
