Reduced Grinding 1.4 (Work In Progress)

I'M CURRENTLY UPDATING THIS FOR 1.4:

I'm going to re-write the description for this mod, but a
here's a summary of this mod:

This mod isn't supposed to make the game too easy, but makes
it so you don't have to spend huge amounts of time farming for
loot. It may also add other conveniences. It's highly
configurable, so you can adjust, enable, or disable features
to your liking.
