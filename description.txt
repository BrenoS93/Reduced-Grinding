This mod will prevent having to spend huge amounts of time farming loot and adds other conveniences. It's highly configurable. Here's a summary of the features (see forum or wiki page).

- Increased item chances for a few enemy drops.
- Item values scale to new drop rates by default.
- Angler Quest per day gradually increases from game progression. Has a short cooldown that may conditionally increase to give all anglers a chance.
- Moonball to advance Moon Phase (requires Meteorite).
- Greater + Super Battle Potion to increase enemy spawns.
- Items that activate Christmas and Halloween for the current day (crafted during their matching season).
- Cancel Invasions when all players are invisible. Also works when players are underground in a non-"Don't Dig Up" world.
- Helpful recipes.

====OFF BY DEFAULT====
